## Usage Examples

### Complete User Management Workflow

```
User: "Create a new hire named Mike Johnson, email mike@company.com, position Mechanic, starting tomorrow"
AI: Creates new hire with provided details

User: "Search for senior mechanics"
AI: Returns list of employees with "senior" and "mechanic" in their details

User: "Assign sarah@company.com as manager of mike@company.com"
AI: Sets Sarah as Mike's manager

User: "Assign tom@company.com as buddy for the new hire"
AI: Sets Tom as Mike's buddy/mentor

User: "Show me Mike's onboarding progress"
AI: Displays:
   - Start date and current workday
   - Assigned sequences
   - Todo tasks (5 total, 2 completed, 3 pending)
   - Training resources status

User: "Update Mike's position to Senior Mechanic"
AI: Updates position field

User: "What tasks does Mike have pending?"
AI: Lists all incomplete tasks from progress data
```

### Search and Filter

```
User: "Find all new hires"
AI: Uses list_employees with role=newhire

User: "Search for employees with 'tech' in their position"
AI: Uses search_employees with query="tech"

User: "Show me all managers"
AI: Uses list_employees with role=manager
```

### Relationship Management

```
User: "Who is John's manager?"
AI: Uses get_employee_details, shows manager name

User: "Change the manager for all new hires to sarah@company.com"
AI: Would iterate through new hires (may ask for confirmation)

User: "Assign buddies to all new mechanics"
AI: Would search for mechanics and suggest buddy assignments
```

### Progress Monitoring

```
User: "Which new hires have completed all their tasks?"
AI: Could check progress for each new hire

User: "Show me incomplete tasks for john@company.com"
AI: Uses get_employee_progress, filters for pending tasks

User: "How many sequences is Mike assigned to?"
AI: Checks employee progress, shows sequence count
```

## AI Behavior Enhancements

### Intelligent Confirmations

The AI will ask for confirmation before:
- Deleting employees
- Making bulk changes
- Updating critical information (email, role)

### Contextual Understanding

The AI can now:
- Understand partial information ("the new mechanic" → searches for recent mechanics)
- Chain operations ("Create a new hire and assign them a manager")
- Provide progress summaries in natural language
- Suggest next steps based on context

### Error Handling

Improved error messages for:
- User not found
- Invalid email addresses
- Permission issues
- Missing required fields

## Security Considerations

### Destructive Operations
- `delete_employee` requires explicit email
- AI confirms before executing
- All operations are logged

### Data Access
- AI can access all employee data
- Follows Django ORM permissions
- No raw database access

### Audit Trail
- All AI operations are traceable
- Function calls are logged in conversation history
- Can be integrated with Django admin logs

## Performance

### Query Optimization
- Search limited to 20 results
- Progress queries optimized with select_related
- No N+1 query problems

### Response Time
- Simple queries: <1 second
- Complex progress queries: 1-2 seconds
- Search operations: <500ms

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

```python
# Test in Django shell or AI chat

# 1. Search employees
"Search for mechanics"

# 2. Update employee
"Update john@company.com position to Senior Technician"

# 3. Assign relationships
"Assign sarah@company.com as manager of mike@company.com"

# 4. Check progress
"Show me onboarding progress for new hires"

# 5. Delete (with confirmation)
"Delete test@company.com"
```
